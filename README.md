**Introduction:**

This project delves into the salaries of Major League Soccer (MLS) players in **2017**, the most recent year available for analysis. Through a comprehensive dataset, we explore the highest individual salaries, average salaries by club, and the highest-paid positions in the league.

**Key Findings:**

* **Highest-Paid Player:** Kaká, from Orlando City, reigned as the highest-paid player in 2017, earning an annual salary of $120,000.

* **Clubs with Highest Average Salaries:** Toronto FC ($150,000), New York FC ($116,000), Chicago Fire ($87,000), Los Angeles Galaxy ($81,000), and Orlando City ($80,000) formed the elite of teams offering the highest guaranteed average compensation.

* **Top 5 Highest Salaries in 2017:** 
    1. Kaká - Midfielder ($120,000)
    2. Bradley - Defender ($1,100,000)
    3. Villa - Forward ($102,000)
    4. Giovinco - Forward ($102,000)
    5. Pirlo - Midfielder ($102,000)

* **Teams with Highest Average Salaries:** Toronto FC ($135,000), New York FC ($112,000), Chicago Fire ($82,000), Orlando City ($75,000), and Los Angeles Galaxy ($66,000) led the ranking of teams with the highest average salaries.

* **Teams with Lowest Average Salaries:** Los Angeles FC ($11,000), Houston Dynamo ($32,000), and DC United ($33,000) had the lowest average salaries among MLS teams.

* **Salary and Position Relationship:** Midfield ($100,000 average) and forward ($84,000 average) positions enjoyed the highest salaries, followed by defenders ($38,000 average) and goalkeepers ($27,000 average).

* **Curious Observation:** Toronto FC, the 2017 MLS champions, also stood out for offering the highest average salary to their players.

**Additional Considerations:**

* It is crucial to keep in mind that the data used is specific to **2017** and may not reflect current league salaries.
* The methodology used to calculate average salaries may have influenced the results.
* Factors such as contract length, bonuses, and image rights also impact a player's total salary.

**Next Steps:**

* **Trend Analysis:** Explore data from more recent years to identify trends and changes in MLS salary patterns.
* **Performance vs. Salary:** Investigate the relationship between player salaries and their on-field performance.
* **Salary Determinants:** Uncover the factors that influence the determination of player salaries in the MLS.
